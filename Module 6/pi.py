#Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for pi. There are many that use simple arithmetic. Write a program to compute the approximation and then print that value as well as the value of math.pi from the math module

import math

x = (4/1)-(4/3)+(4/5)-(4/7)+(4/9)-(4/11)+(4/13)-(4/15)
print(x)

print(math.pi)
